# commission-organizer

A script for organizing commissions by naming convention.

## Setup

Your files should be named like so:

    <ARTIST>--<TITLE>--<CHAR1>-<CHAR2...>--<RATING>.<EXTENSION>

Then, simply run this script in a directory with all of your commissions, and it will build a static site that can be used to serve them. For an example, see https://drab-makyo.com/commissions
